# Data-driven real estate investment risk model
This project is done as part of Insight Data science program for summer(June-July) session at Seattle. For this project I consulted an online real-estate marketplace company who wants to inform it's customers about the inherent risk in real-estate investment. I worked on to improve on their current model to calculate *Market risk-score*. The company calculates risk-score from the weights that quantify the affect of different Market factors on Change in quarterly returns. I estimated these weights by training linear regression models with data on 6 Market Factors as input and Change in quarterly return as output. Following jupyter notebooks show the codes and executions for each step in this project:
* **Clean and combine data** For this project I combined data from multiple sources into one datatable. Also, I identify different markets on the basis of MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area) code. All the Input data is saved in the '/Data' folder and after running the code in [Data_cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/ViditAg/Insight_project/blob/master/Data_Cleaning.ipynb) a new cleaned datatable is generated, and is saved in file 'Input_data_market_risk_model'.
* **Visualize Data** After getting Change in quarterly returns and 6 Market factors data for all 14 Market areas, I created visualizations  such as time-series plot, scatter plot, Frequency distributions. Run the code in [Data_visualization.ipynb](https://github.com/ViditAg/Insight_project/blob/master/Data_visualization.ipynb) to see plots for 'Seattle Market' and 'All US Market'. 
* **Model training and results** Run the code [Model_training.ipynb](https://github.com/ViditAg/Insight_project/blob/master/Model_training.ipynb) and quartiles of weights are generated for all markets individually and all markets combined. A table and a figure is saved in folders '/Results/Figure' and '/Results/Figure'.
* **Flask app** Once you run the code in [FLask_app.ipynb](https://github.com/ViditAg/Insight_project/blob/master/flask_app.ipynb), following weblink is generated http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Copy and past the link in the web browser (incognito to avoid caching the result image). Also, clear the images in static/images folder after closing the app.
